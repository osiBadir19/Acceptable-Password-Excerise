## in this mission you need to create a password verification function.

##### *The verification conditions are:*

- *the length should be bigger than 6;*
- *should contain at least one digit, but it cannot consist of just digits;*
- *having numbers or containing just numbers does not apply to the password longer than 9;*
- *a string should not contain the word "password" in any case.*


***Input**: A string.*

***Output**: A bool.*

##### Examples:

1. assert is\_acceptable\_password("short") == False
2. assert is\_acceptable\_password("muchlonger") == True
3. assert is\_acceptable\_password("ashort") == False
4. assert is\_acceptable\_password("short54") == True
